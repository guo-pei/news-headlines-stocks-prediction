# Predict Stock Market Trend Using News Headlines
## NLP, Word Embedding, Classification, AWS
Every day the “breaking news” could impact our life decisions. It is especially the case for stock market. I am curious if the daily news headlines could affect the stock market close value of the same day.

The dataset of this project has 8 years of daily news headlines from 2008 to 2016 from Reddit WorldNews, as well as the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) close value of the same dates as the news. 

This will be a binary classification problem. When the target is “0”, the same day DJIA close value decreased compared with the previous day, when the target is “1”, the value rose or stayed the same.
